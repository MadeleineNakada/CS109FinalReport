    <h1>Future Work</h1>
    <p>
        For this project we focused on Content Based Filtering mechanisms to create playlists, and in the future, Collaborative Filtering (CF) mechanisms can be added for a more holistic understanding of the user. CF uses the user's preferences and ratings and similarities between users' tastes, ultimately sometimes leading to unexpected songs being added to playlists.
