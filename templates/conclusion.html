        Ideally, we would have liked to create a model with over 90% accuracy. However, on thing to keep in mind is that
        playlist generation isn't nearly as clear cut a problem as cancer classification or digit identification. Taste
        is something that is inherently subjective and hard to quantify, although we did try to come up with our own
        measurement of success by taking a partial playlist and trying to generate the rest of it.
    </p>
    <p>
        We came up with a number of models and ways to predict songs. The below table shows that the best model may not
        correlate to the best prediction method. For example, we found that playlists generated on random songs had higher
        accuracies on our test set. However, if we select random songs to predict from, we can see that the songs we end up
        getting aren't a great fit for the original playlist. However, fitting a model from songs in the genre ended up
        creating a much more difficult identification problem since the songs not in the playlist were very similar to the
        songs in the playlist. The two models trained using this method ended up rejecting all the songs, and so were also
        not great for prediction.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, we did have two models that, subjectively, performed the task of model prediction fairly well. The first
        model was a combination of the two models described above. Using the models trained on randomly sampled data, we
        then fed them songs similar to the given playlist based on genre and year, and then let them identify the songs. In
        the below table the results are in the 3th and 5th columns. The titles of the songs seem more similar to the songs
        in the original playlist.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also managed to improve our models trained on the genre/year specific data by decreasing the number of non-playlist
        songs in the test and train data. We used these models on the genre specific data and we can see that the results are
        similar to the previously discussed model.

    <h3>So Which is "Best"</h3>
    <p>The best performing model on the test data was the Neural Network trained with 30 random genre-specific songs.
      However, we'd stop short of saying this is the "best" model for two reasons. First, we'd like to see if we could
      create a higher accuracy model in the future. Most of our time was spent wrangling the data into our dataset and
      we think with a little more experimentation we could get accuracy over 85%. This belief is in part driven by the fact
      that we were never really able to improve our neural network accuracy above our baseline level using examples from class.
    </p>
    <p>
        Second, there are shortcomings to all these models. The models that predict from random data clearly are flawed
        as the songs don't seem very similar to the original playlist. However, as we can see above, using Spotify's API to
        filter songs from a playlist's most popular genre/year gives the same result for the same genre and year. We filtered out
        songs that were already in the playlist, but if a user repeatedly asked one of our models for recommendations, they would
        always get the same response. We discuss possible solutions to this issue in the next section.
